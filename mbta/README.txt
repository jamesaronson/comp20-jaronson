1) I did not implement the train schedules in the infowindows. I was able to get the JSON data, but did not sort thorugh it and display it. Explanation is in code under the getSchedule function.
2)I did not collaborate with anyone.
3) I spent approximately 10 hrs working on this. I believe I could have finished with another hour to sort out the JSON.
