1) I implemented the changes to the 2048 files correctly. I believe that I have completed the get '/' correctly and get '/scores.json' correctly. However, I ahve not been able to isolate my problem with storing the data. 
2) I met with Abdi the TA briefly and discussed some general syntax questions. 
3) I have spent approximately 10hrs on this assignment.
