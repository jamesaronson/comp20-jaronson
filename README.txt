1. This repository serves as a way to host my assignments as I work on them and to submit them when completed
2. My favorite assignment was mbta. It was the first of the assignment that I felt I was actually doing something that could potentially be useful.
3. When I started this course, I had no idea what web programming entailed. While there still much in the course itself that I can come to understand much better, I believe that I can at least now understand the frameworks of web design and figure out the things I don't know. 
4. The most important thing I learned was to use StackOverFlow/google. All of the issues I face now web programming have already been addressed. It makes sense to capitalize on others experiences to expedite my own learning. Ex. 1) MBTA info windows. Originally, my method for creating the infowindows was slow and overly complex. I was able to find a much simpler solution on stackoverflow. 2) Syntax for server side get request on the mongoDB. By simply looking up the answer, I could have saved myself a lot of time and finished the project properly.
5. While I have finished the course (almost done), I would say there is still a lot that I would want to revisit before moving on to new topics. I was very interested in taking web programming, but this semester proved to be a poor time to take it. With my other design courses for ME, notably senior capstone and robotics, I was not able to devote nearly the time I would have liked to properly learn the material in this course. Thus, my future direction would be to revisit what we have covered and to try to come away with a deeper understanding o the material.
